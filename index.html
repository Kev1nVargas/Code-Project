        <h1>Kevin Vargas</h1>
        <p class="words"> I like playing sports and videogames, being lazy and eating lots of food. I aspire to become successful in life and make enough money so that i can take care of my family. My favorite food is steak and my favorite color is blue. I love sleeping but I also love staying up late at night.I feel like games and music can take my mind off stress like Covid-19 or just school and other things.Im not allergic to anything, I joined this class so I can try new things, see what I like
